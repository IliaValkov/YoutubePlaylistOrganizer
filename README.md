# YoutubePlaylistOrganizer
Independent project for application that augments YouTube playlist interaction. 

The aim of this project is my own personal exercise. It builds on top of what I have learned in F.Zammeti's book "Modern Full-Stack Development: Using TypeScript, React, Node.js, Webpack, and Docker".

## Concept

The main idea is to enable additional funcionality to YouTube playlists.

### Suggested features

- Adding time markers
- Adding notes to videos
- Producing a PDF with user notes

If you are interested in my personal thought process and approach to developing, I welcome you to see the trello board for this project.
